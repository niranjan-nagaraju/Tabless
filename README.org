* Idea
*** Firefox plugin/extension
***** phase 1: Display a tree of links from their originating points.
***** phase 2: Add search
***** phase 3: Display single tab at a time.. Let users switch to tabs from tabless page.
******* Ergo.. become a full-fledged tab manager (optionally, ofcourse)

* Why?
*** Often times, I open a series of pages from reddit, SO, HN, etc and I need to remember where to go back for their comments.
***** or maybe sometimes, I just find it easier to navigate through pages when I remember my workflow starting from an empty tab.

* The what?
*** Unrelated pages will be different trees of their own.
*** Workflow
***** Open FF
******* reddit.com
********* link1 (back to reddit.com)
********* link2
*********** browse to link2/somepage
******* 9gag.com
********* 9gag.com/page1
*********** fb profile
********* 9gag.com/page2
*** Display links like in org-mode
*** Configure
***** purge timeout
***** Use as tab-manager replacement or just for quick switching occasionally
******* i.e. dont bother me unless i press C-e explicitly
******* put me back in default FF tab mode when i exit from tabless
*** Easy search (fuzzy search/partial keyword search) to switch to a tab
*** Color active/closed tabs
*** expand/unexpand all a.l.a S-tab in org-mode
*** Highlight current selection
*** Keyboard shortcuts
***** C-e open tabless
******* s - search
******* Ret - Switch to active tab/open clicked in link a new tab (old inactive closed tab)
********* if not in "leaf" node [i.e. not last entry in a tab group], open all links (if inactive),
********* if active non leaf, merely switch to it.
******* S-tab - cycle through tab "groups"
******* r - remove entry
******* p - purge all tabs (remove all tab groups, active tabs will be closed.. FF history will still have all tabs visited)
********* At this point, tabless puts u back in FF tab bar.
******* n - new tab
********* puts in FF tab bar
******* Arrows/hjkl - navigation
******* x - exit
*** Mouse?
***** Just to click links
